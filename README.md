# Credit Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to use different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes .Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then,  use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next,  compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.Several different algorithms are used to predict credit risk. The performance of these different models are compared and recommendations are suggested based on the results.
